## **THE MISSION**

**What we're building**: Financial incentive system that pays citizens to help insects, tracked by a game, monitored by AI. Like Las Vegas water conservation but for biodiversity.

**Why we'll win**: Everyone else will build fancy tech with no implementation plan. We're building simple tech with a bulletproof policy framework.
